"""
Searching Challenge

Have the function SearchingChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed and find the longest substring that contains k unique characters,
where k will be the first character from the string. The substring will start from the second position in the string because the first character
will be the integer k. For example: if str is "2aabbacbaa" there are several substrings that all contain 2 unique characters,
namely: ["aabba", "ac", "cb", "ba"], but your program should return "aabba" because it is the longest substring. If there are 
multiple longest substrings, then return the first substring encountered with the longest length. k will range from 1 to 6.
Once your function is working, take the final output string and combine it with your ChallengeToken, both in reverse order and separated by a colon.

Examples

Input: "3aabacbebebe"
Output: cbebebe
Final Output: ebebebc

Input: "2aabbcbbbadef"
Output: bbcbbb
Final Output: bbbcbb
